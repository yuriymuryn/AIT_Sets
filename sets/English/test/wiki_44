Joris Luyendijk (; born 30 December 1971) is a Dutch non-fiction author, news correspondent, and talk show host.
Joris Luyendijk was born on 30 December 1971 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He lived in Hilversum from the age of five.
Luyendijk studied in Kansas, Amsterdam, and Cairo. He earned his Master's degree equivalent "doctoraal" degree in Cairo. His first book "Een goede man slaat soms zijn vrouw" (1998, "A Good Man Sometimes Beats His Wife") is about the Egyptian society from a Western observer's point of view.
He eventually became a news correspondent for various Netherlands-based media organisations in the Middle East for a number of years. He was based in Egypt, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. He also reported on the Second Gulf War in Iraq. His book "Het zijn net mensen" (2006, "They're just like people") is a report of his experiences as a news correspondent in the Middle East, and quickly became a bestseller in the Netherlands. The book has since been translated and published in Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Australia, the US, France and Slovenia. The title in English is "Fit to Print" (Australia), "Hello, Everybody!" (UK) or "People Like Us" (US).
In "People Like Us", Luyendijk tells the story of his five years as a correspondent in the Middle East. He chronicles first-hand experiences of dictatorship, occupation, terror, and war. His stories cast light on a number of major crises, from the Iraq War to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, along with less-reported issues such as underage orphan trash-collectors in Cairo. The more he witnessed, the less he understood, and he became increasingly aware of the yawning gap between what he saw on the ground and what was later reported in the media.
From 2006, Joris Luyendijk was living in Amsterdam. In the summer of 2006 and 2007 he carried out interviews for the talk show "Zomergasten" ("Summer Guests") on VPRO. From January 2010, he held the Leonardo Chair at the University of Tilburg, and taught the masterclass “Journalism for the 21st Century”. Luyendijk studied Arabic in Amsterdam and Cairo.
In September 2010 Joris Luyendijk was asked to shadow the Dutch Parliament and government in The Hague for a month, resulting in a book on Dutch politics, titled "Je hebt het niet van mij, maar..." ("You didn't hear it from me, but..."). From 2011 Luyendijk was based in London where he worked for "The Guardian". In "The Joris Luyendijk Banking Blog" he provided an anthropological perspective on the financial world. In Dutch-language newspapers "NRC Handelsblad" and "De Standaard" Luyendijk commented weekly on his life in the City. His book about the City "Swimming with Sharks" has appeared in over fifteen countries and was the best-selling book of 2015 in the Netherlands.

Vertigo is the second studio album by the English electronica duo Groove Armada, released in 1999 on the Jive Electro record label. It contains the well-known singles "At the River" (which was previously featured on the duo's debut album "Northern Star") and "I See You Baby".
"I See You Baby" has been used in advertisements for the Ford Fiesta and the Renault Megane, the latter of which caused a number of complaints due to the song's lyrical content.
As of 2001, sales in the United States have exceeded 120,000 units, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Chappel is a village and Civil parish in the borough of Colchester, Essex which sits on the River Colne. It is famous for its Victorian viaduct, which crosses the Colne valley.
The present name of "Chappel" derives from the construction of a small chapel of ease, noted in 1285 AD as standing at the northern boundary of the parish of Great Tey. During the 16th century, because of concerns from Chappel residents about the distance to Great Tey's own church at festival time, this area was split from the parish and become a separate entity known as "Pontisbright" (lit. "Britric's bridge") that would eventually become known as "Chappel".
In 1433, the vicar of Great Tey agreed that the inhabitants of Chappel could find and elect their own chaplain. The benefice itself was united with that of the neighbouring village of Wakes Colne in 1938. The chapel itself, now the parish church of St Barnabas, is a grade I listed building.
The Chappel viaduct was built between 1847 and 1849 for the Colchester and Stour extension of the Eastern Counties Railway. Originally planned to be a timber structure, the viaduct was built of locally made brick because of the additional cost of maintaining a timber structure. Approximately 600 men were involved in the construction, most of whom were local East Anglians. The cost of construction was approximately £21,000 (approximately £2.2 million in 2016 money).
The viaduct consists of 32 arches of span, with a total length of , and a maximum height of . The piers consist of two shafts, separated by a opening, and joined at top and bottom by arches; each shaft contain a hollow void by maximum, partially filled with concrete to the level of the bottom arch. The running level of the viaduct has a gradient of 1 in 120
The viaduct became a listed monument in 1967, and is thought to be the second-largest brick-built structure in England after Battersea Power Station.
During the commemoration events to mark 50 years since the end of the second world war, Chappel's beacon was transported by rail to a point on the viaduct where it could be seen from the playing field below, and lit after a ceremonial silence, the beginning and end of which were marked by the release of two maroons.
The first passenger train to Sudbury, carrying an official party from Colchester, ran on 2 July 1849. The viaduct currently carries the Marks Tey to Sudbury branch railway (Gainsborough Line), which connects regularly with trains to and from London's Liverpool Street Station.
The village has a pub dating from the 13th century, a parish church, a United Reformed church, a post office and general store, village hall and a railway station, Chappel and Wakes Colne station, which houses the East Anglian Railway Museum. It also has a children's play area which was upgraded in 2007/08 by Chappel Parish Council.
In celebration of the millennium, the Chappel Millennium Green was opened. The Millennium Green has two areas: a nature reserve with board walk and a mown grass area for general recreation isbordered by a gravel path. It has also hosted several events, including the burning of a beacon and Colne Valley Festival events.
Chappel's village sign depicts a bridge crossing a river, symbolic of the old bridge, dating from 1140 AD, which crossed the river Colne and connected the two halves of the estate of Crepping Manor. The lord of the manor was, at that time, responsible for its upkeep.

Micropolis, "la cité des insectes" (city of insects) is situated in the Lévézou region of France, at Saint-Léons, near Millau. Micropolis is a museum dedicated to entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre and inspired by the film, "Microcosmos".
Micropolis is also a scientific centre with an experimental station on biodiversity.
