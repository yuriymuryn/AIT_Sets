Villy Sørensen (13 January 1929 – 16 December 2001) was a Danish short-story writer, philosopher and literary critic of the Modernist tradition. His fiction was heavily influenced by his philosophical ideas, and he has been compared to Franz Kafka in this regard. He was the most influential and important Danish philosopher since Søren Kierkegaard.
Born in Copenhagen, Sørensen graduated from the Vestre Borgerdydskole in 1947, and then attended the University of Copenhagen and the University of Freiburg studying philosophy. Although he did not graduate, he later received an honorary degree from the University of Copenhagen.
Sørensen published his first collection of short stories, "Strange Stories" in 1953, which many critics have identified as being the start of Danish literary Modernism. He published additional collections of short stories in 1955 and 1964, all winning various awards in Denmark. These stories generally explored the absurd and hidden parts of the human psyche.
Sørensen began editing the journal "Vindrosen" (with Klaus Rifbjerg) in 1959. Afterward, he became a member of the Danish Academy in 1965, subsequently editing several other Modernist journals and periodicals. Sørensen, though he continued to produce short fiction throughout his life, was also deeply engaged in philosophy, about which he wrote many essays and several books including "Seneca: The Humanist at the Court of Nero" and his response to Søren Kierkegaard's "Either/Or", "Hverken-eller" (i.e. "Neither/Nor"). He also published books and essays about Nietzsche, Kafka, Marx, Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard, and was a notable translator of over 20 books. He was awarded the Grand Prize of the Danish Academy in 1962, The Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1974, the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1983, the inaugural Swedish Academy Nordic Prize in 1986, along with many other awards and recognitions. He died in Copenhagen in 2001.

Venados de Mazatlán () are a baseball team in the Mexican Pacific League. In 2016, the team won the Mexican Pacific League Championship and went on to win their second Caribbean Series, which was played in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. 
In the 2004-2005 season, the Venados of Mazatlán won the Mexican Pacific League title for the seventh time. The Caribbean Series was held at Teodoro Mariscal Stadium in Mazatlán, and the Venados performed well out of the gate, winning twice against the Dominican Republic's Águilas Cibaeñas and Puerto Rico's Indios de Mayaguez.
The 2005 team had a star-studded lineup, including Miguel Ojeda, Elmer Dessens, Luis Ayala, Jorge Campillo, Vinny Castilla, Erubiel Durazo, Johnny Gomes and Francisco Campos. The Venados beat Venezuela's Tigres de Aragua in their first head-to-head game, with Campos pitching a three-hit shutout.
Campos went on to pitch in the final against the Aguilas, pitching eight innings and giving up two runs and three hits for the victory in a 4-3 Venados win. The resulting Caribbean Series Championship was the first in club history.
Estadio Teodoro Mariscal was constructed in 1962 with a capacity of 14,000 and is primarily used for baseball. It is 325 feet down the stadium's right and left field lines and 400 feet to the center field wall. The stadium is located in between Avenida Insurgentes and Reforma near Bosque de la Ciudad and The Aquarium. A famous singer, El Coyote, is said to regularly attend Venados games at Estudio Marsical. In 2000 the stadium underwent a major remodeling that expanded capacity from 12,000 to 14,000.

Elixir is a British heavy metal band, formed by Steve Bentley, Kevin Dobbs, Nigel Dobbs and Phil Denton in November 1983. They are notable for being associated with the new wave of British heavy metal movement.
The band spent the first time after having formed writing material and rehearsing. After brief stints as "Purgatory" and "Hellfire" the members finally decided on naming the band "Elixir". According to the biography on the band's website the name was chosen through Steve Bentley closing his eyes and putting his finger on a word in a dictionary at random. In need of a vocalist Elixir recruited singer Sally Pike, but after recording a four song demo tape and playing two gigs together, she left the band by the end of the year. In 1984 Pike was replaced by Paul Taylor, and later the same year guitarist Norman Gordon joined the band to fill the vacant spot left by Steve Bentley, who departured after Elixir had completed their second demo tape.
In 1985, Elixir released their debut single "Treachery (Ride like the Wind)" / "Winds of Time". This single was reviewed by Ronnie James Dio in "Kerrang!" (No 99), and was given the thumbs up.
In 1986, the band recorded their first album "The Son of Odin". In issue 137 (November 2005) of Terrorizer magazine, the album was included in the top 20 power metal albums of all time, alongside Judas Priest's "Painkiller", Helloween's "Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II" and Cirith Ungol's "King of the Dead".
Elixir recorded their second album, initially called "Sovereign Remedy" in 1988 with Mark White on the bass and former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr. Stevie Hughes replaced Burr for the band's live commitments through 1989. At the end of the year, Phil Denton quit the band and was replaced by Leon Lawson for several live shows before the band came off the road. Their second album was released by the Sonic label as "Lethal Potion" in 1990. In 2004, the album was re-released as "Sovereign Remedy" on the TPL label, as it was originally intended, with all the tracks, the original mix and new artwork.
In 2001 the band reverted to the Paul Taylor, Phil Denton, Norman Gordon, Kevin Dobbs and Nigel Dobbs line up and in 2003 recorded their third album "The Idol", which was made up of material the band had written in the 1980s. With rising popularity, the band toured around various countries such as Greece, Germany and the United States.
Elixir recorded their fourth album "Mindcreeper" in 2006, which was released by Majestic Rock.
Elixir released their latest album "All Hallows Eve" on 31 October 2010 on their own CTR label.
Between 2006 and 2012, Elixir organised six editions of the "British Steel Festival", appearing on the bill at each event. From 2008 onwards, the festival was held at the Camden Underworld.
Elixir disbanded in 2012, with members Paul Taylor and Phil Denton going on to form the metal/rock band Midnight Messiah.
Clive Burr died a year later, due to complications related to MS.
