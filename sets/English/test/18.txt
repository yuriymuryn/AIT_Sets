He might also point
out all the problems that don't most naturally have this structure.  Likewise, some
machine learning people might say that the idea of different "states"
at different "times," again, "just" describes a particular structure of
Bayes net.  You can also combine #1 and #2 to arrive at POMDPs, which
are the most general (single-player) discrete--time-and-state problem.  But despite all this, I think the two problems I listed above capture the essence of most things.
Why has nobody included basic calculus...?

Robotics probably means optical/sensory interpretation would be part of the maths. 
Im not sure of the names of the areas of mathematics for the different cognitive/perception processing.
