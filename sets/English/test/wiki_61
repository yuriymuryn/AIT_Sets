Louis Andre Baert (29 December 1903 in Ghent – 11 July 1969 in Ghent) was an international football referee from Belgium, particularly active during the 1930s.
Baert first came to international prominence in the 1934 World Cup in Italy. He was selected as the referee for the quarter-final match between Italy, the hosts, and Spain. Bert initially disallowed an equalising goal from Italy, but changed his decision after protests from the Italian team. In a 2010 Sports Illustrated article, Georgina Turner suggested that Mussolini's influence may have affected the refereeing at the world cup.
He was selected to run the line with Ivan Eklind in both the semi-final and the final, and went on to have a lengthy international career as a referee. Baert was also the referee for the match during the 1938 World Cup in which Italy, playing in their infamous "" strip, beat France in Paris. In total he took part in six World Cup matches.
He first refereed internationals on 9 May 1929 and ended on 29 June 1952. After retiring from active football he became a member of the Executive Panel of the Belgian Football Association until his death in 1969.

The angélique (French, from Italian angelica) is a plucked string instrument of the lute family of the baroque era. It combines features of the lute, the harp, and the theorbo.
It shares the form of its pear shaped body as well as its vibrating string length of 54 to 70 cm with the lute. Differing from the lute, the 16 string angelica was single-strung like a theorbo, with which it shares its extended neck with a second peg box, bearing six bass strings.
The angelica was tuned diatonically, like a harp: C – E – F – G – A – B – c – d – e – f – g – a – b – c’ – d’ – e’. That range is the same as that of the French or lesser theorbo, but the latter differs in that its tuning is reentrant: C – D – E – F – G – A – B – c – d – g – c' – e'– a – d'. The diatonic tuning limited its compass, but produced a full and clear tone by the increased use of open strings.
Little surviving music for the angelica as well as few surviving instruments indicate that the angelica flourished during the second half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries.
Some authors claim that the angelica was invented in England. But that claim is based on the misinterpretation of its name (M. H. Fuhrmann, Musicalischer Trichter, Frankfurt/Spree 1706, p. 91). James Talbot correctly interpreted angelica as “angel lute“ because of its lovely sound (ms. Oxford 532, 1685–1701). 
Music for the angelica is notated in French tablature, with the designation of bass courses varying according to respective authors. 
Ukrainian Torban is a descendant of Angélique.

Bramwith railway station was a small station on the South Yorkshire Railway's line between Doncaster and Thorne. It served the village of Kirk Bramwith, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. The original line followed closely the canal bank coming close to the village.

Uzbekist is the standard time in Uzbekistan; it is 5 hours ahead of UTC, . The standard time uses no daylight saving time, though there has been constant debate whether to adopt it in order to increase leisure time.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union there were two time zones in Uzbekistan. In the Soviet era most time zones were daylight time in the winter and double daylight time in the summer. The western part of the country observed Samarkand Time 5 or 6 hours ahead of UTC. The eastern part observed Tashkent Time 6 or 7 hours ahead of UTC. In 1991 the clocks did not move forward in the spring to maintain single daylight time only in the summer. That fall a unified time zone was adopted 5 hours ahead of UTC.

Virtue ethics, one of the three major approaches in normative ethics, focuses on what makes a good person, rather than what makes a good action. It can be described as a teleological ethical system - one that seeks to define the proper "telos" (goal or end) of the human person. Virtue ethics emphasizes moral character, in contrast to other normative approaches which emphasize duties or rules (deontology) or which emphasize the consequences of actions (consequentialism). Three key concepts virtue ethics are arete (excellence or virtue), phronesis (practical or moral wisdom), and eudaimonia (usually translated as happiness or flourishing.

Henri Christophe (23 July 1884 – 17 June 1968) was an international football referee from Belgium in the 1920s and 1930s.
Christophe had established his international reputation at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam – but had been a referee from 1919 and, due to Belgian's participation in the 1930 FIFA World Cup – travelled to South America alongside Jean Langenus—on board the SS "Conte Verde"—as one of four Europeans who officiated during the competition.
Christophe had refereed two matches at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, including the France v Italy match during the tournament. He took charge of the Sweden v Egypt quarter-final in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris and one game Italy v France in the 1928 Summer Olympics. In Uruguay he ran the line to compatriot Jean Langenus in the final.
He was a fan of and, later, President of Cercle Sportif Vervietois.

Daniel Yves Alfred Gélin (19 May 1921 – 29 November 2002) was a French film and television actor.
Gélin was born in Angers, Maine-et-Loire, the son of Yvonne (née Le Méner) and Alfred Ernest Joseph Gélin. 
When he was ten, his family moved to Saint-Malo where Daniel went to college until he was expelled for 'uncouthness'. His father then found him a job in a shop that sold cans of salted cod. It was seeing the shooting of Marc Allegret's film "Entree des artistes" that triggered his desire to go to Paris to train to be an actor. He trained at the Cours Simon in Paris before entering the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique. There he met Louis Jouvet and embarked on a theatrical career. He made his first film appearance in 1940 in "Miquette" and for several years was an extra or played small roles in French films. He appeared with Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich in "Martin Roumagnac" (1946).
He won his first leading role in "Rendez-vous de juillet" (1949). From that time, he went on to appear in more than 150 films, including Max Ophüls' films "La Ronde" (1950) and "Le Plaisir" (1952), Sacha Guitry's films "Si Versailles m'était conté ("Royal Affairs in Versailles")" (1954) and "Napoléon" (1955), Alfred Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1956), Jean Cocteau's "Le Testament d'Orphée" (1960), "Le souffle au cœur" (Murmur of the Heart) (1971), and "La Nuit de Varennes" ("That Night in Varennes") (1982). He also wrote and directed one film, "The Long Teeth", in 1952.
Gélin was a leading man in French cinema during the 1950s, but his career declined with the coming of the New Wave. He worked in theater for several years, but later found new success on screen as a character actor. He appeared extensively in French films and television productions from the 1970s until his death, often playing cynical characters or grumpy old men.
While married to Danièle Delorme with whom he had a son, Xavier, he had an affair with model Marie Christine Schneider that produced a daughter, Maria Schneider. However, Gélin refused to acknowledge Maria throughout his life. Gélin also had a daughter, Bénédicte from a later marriage.
Gélin died in Paris on November 29, 2002, of kidney failure.
