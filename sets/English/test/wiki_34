Cylons are a fictional race of robots in the original "Battlestar Galactica" TV series. They are the primary antagonists of the series and are at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity. The Cylons also appeared in the short-lived 1980 spin-off series "Galactica 1980."
An updated version of the original Cylon also appears in the re-imagined series: briefly in a flashback battle sequence in "", in hand-to-hand combat with a young William Adama after they had shot each other's fighters down; and several in the show finale "Daybreak", on board an old Cylon refuge known as "The Colony".
The Cylons were created by a reptilian race, also called Cylons. However, the reptilian race died out centuries earlier, leaving behind only their race of robots.
The Imperious Leader is the leader of the Cylon Alliance and most advanced Cylon model. According to the IL-Series Cylon "Lucifer", the Imperious Leader is an IL-Series Cylon, although it does not look like an IL-Series Cylon. All of the Imperious Leaders look identical.
The Imperious Leader has a third brain and a body shell resembling the reptilian Cylons. The original novelization of the pilot episode states that the Imperious Leader's third brain is specifically designed to emulate the human mind (solely for the purpose of anticipating human actions). Since the novelization, however, also specifically describes the Cylons as living, organic reptilian beings, rather than robots, it is not clear whether the robot Imperious Leader has a third brain or not. The reptilian look of the Imperious Leader suggests the question whether actually all living Cylons have died out.
One Imperious Leader was killed at the Battle of Carillon (pilot episode). His successor was possibly destroyed during the Battle of Gamoray (episode: "The Living Legend, Part 2").
In the original 1978-79 series, the voices of both the Imperious Leader and Count Iblis are identical, having been provided by Patrick Macnee (who played Count Iblis on camera). In the "Galactica 1980" episode "Space Croppers", the voice of the Imperious Leader was provided by Dennis Haysbert.
Although they look much more civilian than centurions, IL-series Cylons act as commanders for the military and governors for civilians of the Alliance . They have two brains, and a mostly transparent head through which various lights can be seen pulsing. They also have a metallic, humanoid face with two eye scanners (compared to the single eye scanner of the Centurion models), and wear clothing (full-length glittering robes). Two IL-series Cylons have been featured onscreen, both of which have an effete human-sounding voice, unlike the flat mechanical tones of Centurions. They are: 
Two additional IL-Series Cylons are shown on-screen on the Cylon capitol of Gamoray during the Imperious Leader's visit, which occurred during the episode "The Living Legend, Part II". Lucifer refers to the second Imperious Leader as being upgraded from an IL-model like himself.
Command Centurion are Centurions with gold armor. These are the lower commanders for individual military units, though they can be responsible for entire Basestars and garrisons. The most well-known Cylon of this model is Commander Vulpa (so identified in "The Cylon Death Machine," Robert Thurston's novelization of "The Gun on Ice Planet Zero"). Their voices are slightly lower pitched than regular Centurions.
In the novelization of the original series it is stated that there is an elite class of Command Centurions (referred to as First Centurions), roughly equivalent to feudal Counts, which act as executive officers to the Imperious Leader and are not subordinate to the IL-Series, and (like the IL-series) they were also said to have multiple brains. In the TV series these are actually seen on screen, though very rarely, and are distinguished from other Command Centurions by black bands on their gold armor. Vulpa was originally of this class but had been demoted and stationed on ice planet Arcta.
Military androids with silver armor. Basic Centurions make up the ground forces and pilots of the Alliance military. Although Earth's Roman Centurions commanded a unit of eighty men, Cylon Centurions form the rank and file of the Cylon forces.
Centurions are armed with a powerful energy weapon, often referred to as a blaster rifle. They also have bayonets and swords for close combat and the execution of prisoners.
Some Centurions in the series have been given names: 
The Cylon Centurions – the type most often depicted in the original "Battlestar Galactica" — were strikingly similar to the Imperial stormtroopers of "Star Wars" (in fact, both were designed by the same concept artist, Ralph McQuarrie). The similarities were so strong that it was one of the factors that prompted 20th Century Fox's lawsuit for copyright infringement against Universal Studios, owners of the "Battlestar Galactica" copyright. However, the lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful.
Both the gold Command Centurions and the silver Centurions had their voices vocalized with the use of an EMS Vocoder 2000.
There is also a unique Cylon with glittering robes, with a metallic humanoid face. They are seen in the Imperious Leader's delegation to Gamoray in "The Living Legend". This is evidently some kind of civilian Cylon, as Gamoray is said to have a very large community of civilian Cylons, though how civilian Cylon society differs from its military is never explored. This is the only known kind of civilian Cylons. However as they must have had some kind of admission to the reception of the Imperious Leader it can be assumed that they are not typical civilian Cylons; they were perhaps members of some kind of aristocracy.
The Cylon "humanoid" is a rather new model, probably first built long after the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of the Humans.
Although entirely mechanical beneath an artificial skin, the humanoid model is, in fact, an android, featuring a superficial, human appearance, as well as a condescending attitude toward the non-humanoid Centurions.
Two Cylon humanoids are featured in the episode "The Night the Cylons Landed" of "Galactica 1980", one of which is named Andromus.
The Cylons are described as a devoted race that spends no time in any idle pursuits, and they employ several models, but only of necessary spacecraft, such as these:
In the 1978 "Galactica" movie and series and the 1980 spin-off, the Cylons were created by an extinct reptilian race that were also called Cylons, as related by Apollo in the premiere episode. In the episode "War of the Gods", Count Baltar mentions that the reptilian Cylons were ultimately "overcome by their own technology" (particularly after the Imperious Leader was created, despite having had a "slight error" in its programming), and recognizes Iblis's voice as that of the Cylon leader, and Iblis counters that if that were true, it must have been "transcribed" over a thousand yahren (years) ago.
At the beginning of the series the Cylons are singularly devoted to the destruction of humanity. The war started when the Cylon Empire sought to expand into the territory of the Hasaris, and the Human Colonies intervened on behalf of the conquered Hasaris. Due to those events, the Cylon Empire now viewed the entire human race as a target.
Cylons are led by the Imperious Leader, an IL-Series Cylon elevated to a supreme leadership position over all Cylons. All Cylons, from the IL-series down, typically repeat the phrase "By Your Command" when responding to any order.
The Cylon Empire is also responsible for tributary powers under the aegis of the Cylon Alliance. The Ovions (an insectoid race enslaved by the Cylons and transported to the planet Carillon for mining purposes) are the only known member of the Cylon Alliance shown onscreen. Aside from the Ovions and (the defeated) Hasaris, the only other known race conquered by the Cylons are the Delphians, which are mentioned to have been exterminated in "The Living Legend."
Cylon society appears to be almost exclusively military. Until the discovery of Gamoray, which the Colonial fleet had targeted for its rich fuel reserves, no civilian Cylon outpost had ever been seen by anyone.
The Berkley book series also explored two other aspects of Cylon design. The first is the development of multiple brain status. This allows Cylons additional thinking and deductive abilities. The second is an unexplained talent for knowing when a human is lying, which was suggested in the episode "The Lost Warrior".
Presented in "The Gun on Ice Planet Zero" book, the second of the two novels written before the network insisted the Cylons become robots, multi-brain status is the surgical inclusion of an auxiliary brain, allowing for higher-level thinking abilities. The command centurion and garrison commander on planet Tairac, Vulpa, demonstrated this ability.
According to the Maximum Press comic of "Battlestar Galactica", just prior to the start of The Thousand Yahren War, the Cylons's Imperious Leader made a deal with the mysterious and demonic Count Iblis (meaning "Satan" in the Arabic language) to betray his entire race in exchange for power that would allow him to "become like Count Iblis". Count Iblis, however, having lied about the process of "empowerment", instead changed the Imperious Leader into a cybernetic entity, more machine than organic being. Enraged, the Imperious Leader swore revenge and became more and more driven by conquest and warfare.
In the Maximum Press comic, the Cylons were originally led by a ruthless, conquest and expansionism-driven emperor named Sobekkta, one of the original living Cylons, who were a race of intelligent humanoid reptiles.
In Battlestar Galactica # 16 Berserker !, Apollo, during a planetary search, unfortunately comes across a lone Mark III prototype Cylon, which proves to be more creative and adaptive like humans in his strategy, giving it more capability to defeat humans. The existing Cylons deemed this advanced Cylon prototype more a threat to them, however, due to his unquenchable megalomania to rule, and so they marooned him far from the Cylon empire until needed (if ever).
The Cylons also appear in the official computer game adaptation, which is a prequel to both the original and re-imagined series.
Larami came out with a bubble toy in 1978 called the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Bubble Machine as well as a line of other inexpensive toys.
