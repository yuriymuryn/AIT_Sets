My question is: is it worth the effort to train for it and apply next year? Will this competition help me with my AI skills? And do I have the skills for it?
Also, what do you think of this competition as a whole?

The problem is the deadline is for less than a month. And it is indeed very challenging. Just reading the rules and understanding them well might take that time. Most contestants have probably been preparing since last year. :/ 
But it really feels like it will scratch that itch I've been having for AI. I just don't know if something else might better.
