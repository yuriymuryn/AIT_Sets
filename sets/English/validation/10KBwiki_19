The Richard Alsop IV House, also known as the Alsop House, is a historic house at 301 High Street in Middletown, Connecticut. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009.
This stately mansion faces east towards the Connecticut River from the west side of High Street opposite the intersection of Court Street. It is set back from the street atop a rise. A high iron fence borders the property along High Street. This house makes an important contribution to the elegance and high style which characterized High Street as the preferred residential area in nineteenth-century Middletown.
The Alsop house was built in 1838–1839 by Richard Alsop IV for his twice-widowed mother, Mrs. Maria (Alsop) Dana. The short-lived architectural firm formed by Landra Beach Platt and Francis Benne who worked together in New Haven under the tutelage of Sidney Mason Stone was evidently responsible for the design, although it is possible that they drew their inspiration from Ithiel Town's own home in New Haven, which may account for the similarities of the two structures as well as for a former attribution of the Alsop House to Town himself. (Stone's possible contributions have yet to be explored.) The well-known Middletown builders, Barzillai Sage and Isaac W. Baldwin, performed the masonry and carpentry work, respectively. The house remained in the hands of Alsop family until its acquisition in 1948 by Wesleyan University.
This house is significant architecturally for its transitional Greek-Tuscan Italianate appearance. The cubical, two-story, central block with overhanging eaves is flanked by colonnaded -story wings. A swag-and-tassel design decorates the frieze of the central block, which also displays a veranda supported by delicate ironwork and surmounted by an intricate balustrade.
A rear colonnaded wing which originally housed servant's quarters and service facility has been enclosed. At the west end of this wing are attached an art gallery of recent construction and the art library, originally the stable.
The interior of the Alsop house is noted for its decorative wall paintings. The stair hall displays trompe l'oeil painting of figures in niches, while the parlors, dining room and morning-room feature oil-on-plaster paintings. The parlor paintings are classically derived and some subjects are Raphaelesque in origin. In the morning room the formal classicism of the parlors is replaced by scenes derived from the "rural" Italian tradition of wall decoration. Local birds and insects are featured in these scenes. The dining room displays a painted frieze.
The main rooms of the house are furnished with period antiques and provide a suitable atmosphere in which to display the wall painting.
In its carefully restored condition, the Alsop house remains a monument to the skill of its designers, while serving Wesleyan University and the community as an art center.
Currently part of the Wesleyan University campus, housing the Davison Art Center, the Richard Alsop IV House has been thoughtfully restored and preserved.

Add a Line was a daytime radio game show which aired on ABC July 4, 1949, to September 26, 1949. The title came from the show's format, which "called for players to add the final line to a rhyme given to them by the host." 
The 30-minute program was broadcast at 2:30 p.m. and other time periods during its run. The host was John Nelson (1915-76), who was heard on other audience participation radio shows, including "Bride and Groom" and "Breakfast at Sardi's". In "Radio and Television" (Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1950), Garnet R. Garrison and Giraud Chester noted:

Mr. Bones, is a multi-genre video game released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, created for SEGA by Ed Annunziata and Zono Incorporated. The game's soundtrack was composed and performed by famed guitarist Ronnie Montrose.
DaGoulian, a mad philosopher who believes that one can only "ensure the survival of good by making evil thrive", sets out to purify the world with evil. By playing a special set of drums powered by science and alchemy, he is able to tap into a primal power which he calls "skeletal magnetism" (or "skeletism") and summon the dead from their graves as his skeletal soldiers.
One inmate of the cemetery, however, is pure of heart and is thus resurrected not with red (evil) skeletism, but with blue (good) skeletism. Because of this, he retains his free will. This fact is quickly noticed by DaGoulian, and he orders his newly created army to destroy this rebel, who calls himself simply "Mr. Bones."
Mr. Bones soon becomes determined to stop DaGoulian's plan. He must find a way to counteract the evil of red skeletism before DaGoulian's minions catch up to him.
One of "Mr. Bones"' most distinctive qualities is in it having very few levels which share the same style of gameplay; with only a few exceptions, almost every level looks and feels different from the rest. Some levels simply change the camera perspective, while others offer up their own distinct genre. The most common thread running throughout the game is that of an action/platform game with slight gameplay and viewing angle variations per level, but at times the styles diverge far more drastically, ranging from a music/rhythm game to a "Breakout"-style game to a game of memorization. Once a level has been beaten, the player can return directly to that level from the main menu any time they choose.
The soundtrack was composed and performed by guitarist Ronnie Montrose, with Jim Hedges credited for "SMPC Music". Montrose also appears in one of the game's video sequences as the blind man who gives Mr. Bones his guitar.
In spite of some positive buzz, the release of "Mr. Bones" was met with little fanfare and it quickly faded into obscurity. However, the game did develop a cult following among retro gamers, not only because of its originality and level variety, but also because of the video sequences peppered throughout the adventure, combining live-action footage with computer-generated characters and environments. The cinematics were designed and directed by Allen Battino, who also performed the role of Mr. Bones via motion capture. Ronnie Montrose’s guitar playing was also motion captured using sensor gloves and transferred to the Mr. Bones animation.

Mary Ann Gilbert (1776 – 26 April 1845) was an English agronomist.
Mary Ann Gilbert was the daughter of Thomas Gilbert, who was a grocer in Lewes, Sussex. When he died in 1782, he left (by her own account) his widow and daughter almost penniless. . After her mother's death in 1807, she frequently stayed with her uncle Charles at Eastbourne.
On 18 April 1808, she married Davies Giddy, a Cornish landowner, who had served as High Sheriff of the Duchy. He was an M.P. for Cornish constituencies from 1806 to 1832. Among his roles in Parliament was as Chairman of the Board of Agriculture. Mary Ann Gilbert was passionately concerned about low agricultural productivity and the plight of the rural poor. Davies was more interested in how the Parish Rate for the support of unemployed might be reduced.
Davies Giddy was also a professional applied mathematician and became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and, for an unhappy period, its President.
In 1814, Mary Ann Gilbert's uncle, Charles Gilbert, died. In his Will, he left her much property in Sussex, or to a future husband, if he changed his name to "Gilbert".
In December 1817 Davies Giddy took his wife's surname, "Gilbert", to perpetuate it. In January 1818, the names of their children were also changed.
Sharing her husband's interest, Mary Ann Gilbert managed some successful practical agronomical experiments at Beachy Head in feeding the poor, or rather, teaching them to feed themselves using land no-one else wanted, for a fair rent. She presented the statistical results of these works to her husband's political, scientific and "County" contacts. She was also a prominent member of the Labourer's Friend Society (later the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes ). Among those who advised her were Richard Whately, Anglican Archbishop of Dublin and his brother, the Vicar of Cookham in Berkshire, Edwin Chadwick and William Gill, of Chacewater, Cornwall.
Her illustrations appear in Thomas Bond's "Topographical and historical sketches of the boroughs of East and West Looe, in the county of Cornwall" (1823). Bond was a cousin of her husband.
Of their eight children, three daughters and a son survived her husband. Their son, John Davies Gilbert (5 December 1811 – 16 April 1854) was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April, 1834. He played a significant part, as landowner, in developing the town of Eastbourne.
Mary Ann Gilbert died on 26 April 1845 at Eastbourne
