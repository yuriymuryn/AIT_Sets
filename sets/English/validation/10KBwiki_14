A field house was added to the elementary school in 1998, where many events are now held.

The Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is a degree-granting institution founded in 1906 as one of five divisions of Carnegie Mellon University's College of Fine Arts. It is widely regarded as one of the best schools of architecture, and one of a shrinking number offering the B.Arch accredited five-year professional degree. The School of Architecture's slogan is 'Where Art and Technology Meet Practice', and the current head of the school is Stephen Lee. In 2015, two School of Architecture professors, Stephen Lee and John Folan, were recognized by Design Intelligence as members of the 30 Most Admired Educators.
The School of Architecture defines architecture as the integrated pursuit of design creativity, historical perspective, social responsibility, technical expertise, and global environmental leadership. Reflecting a focus on architectural excellence as the combination of rigorous fundamental practice and unique specialization, the undergraduate curriculum consists of three years of building studios and core requirements, followed by the student's choice of an Advanced Synthesis Option Studio (ASOS) and numerous electives from within the School of Architecture or the university at large. Interdisciplinary studies are encouraged so that graduates of the B.Arch program have both depth and breadth in their education, able to better respond with innovative solutions to the emerging global challenges of the 21st century.
The School of Architecture's facilities are located on the second floor of the College of Fine Arts building and the second, third, and fourth floors of Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. These two buildings house Undergraduate and Master studios, PhD, administrative, and faculty offices, and several conference spaces as well as the Computational Design (CODE) Lab, a full Wood & Metal Shop, a (Digital Fabrication Lab) dFAB Lab, and the Robert L. Preger Intelligent Workplace, a sustainable "living laboratory" built atop Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall.
The School of Architecture offers a five-year undergraduate degree, as well as seven Master's programs and three Doctorate programs.
