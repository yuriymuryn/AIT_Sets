William Marsden (1796–1867) was an English surgeon whose main achievements are the founding of two presently well-known hospitals, the Royal Free Hospital (in 1828) and the Royal Marsden Hospital (in 1851).
Marsden was born in Sheffield in Yorkshire, the youngest of eight children. When he left school he was apprenticed to a wholesale druggist in Sheffield. In 1816, he moved to London where he took up an apprenticeship to a surgeon-apothecary before setting up on his own. At the end of 1824 he enrolled as a student of surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital under the famous surgeon and lecturer John Abernethy (1764–1831). In April 1827 Marsden passed his MRCS examination to qualify as a full surgeon. He became an MD in 1838. 
After discovering the difficulties the poor had in obtaining medical treatment, Marsden sought to establish a free hospital in London for which "poverty and sickness are the only passports". In 1828 he set up a small dispensary at 16 Greville Street, Hatton Garden, Holborn, which was named the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Cure of Malignant Diseases. This was later constituted as the Royal Free Hospital, and moved to the Gray's Inn Road in the 1840s. 
A few years later, Marsden turned his attention to cancer sufferers and, in 1851, set up another small establishment in Cannon Row, Westminster. This grew into the Brompton Cancer Hospital (now the Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road site).
Marsden married Ann Bishop, known as Betsy-Ann, in 1820. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only one of them, Alexander Edwin Marsden, a surgeon (1832–1902), survived into adulthood. Betsy-Ann died of cancer in 1846 and Marsden married his second wife, Elizabeth Abbott.
William Marsden died in 1867. He is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, South London .

The Church of the Holy Trinity is an historic Episcopal church at 381 Main Street in Middletown, Connecticut, that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 1979, together with its nearby former rectory, also known as the Bishop Acheson House.
This Gothic church at 381 Main Street faces east from the west side of Main Street on the central block between Court and Washington streets. it is set back from the street with a lawn in front. Its substantial appearance, emphasized by the sombre tones of the heavy brownstone construction, contrasts greatly with the flat facades and brightly decorated storefronts on Main Street.
The Episcopal Church in Middletown had its beginnings as early as 1724. Unlike many Colonial Anglican churches, it was firmly committed to the patriot cause during the American Revolution. This is the third meeting house of the parish, which was formally established as Christ Church in 1750. Several of its ministers have become bishops, including Abraham Jarvis, John Williams, and Edward Campion Acheson, father of Dean Acheson.
The church was built in 1870-1874. Henry Dudley was the architect and the firm of McConochie, Moor and Mylechreest was the prime contractor. Constructed of local brownstone, this church displays a symmetrically arranged facade with a buttressed bell tower at the southeast corner. A large rose tracery window is the dominant decorative feature of this facade, which also displays arched and lancet windows. The tower lacks a spire but features narrow arched windows which emphasize its verticality, and echo the fenestration of the facades. The interior displays elaborate tracery trusses support on cast iron posts. The present altar and reredos were added around 1892 and were designed by Charles Haight of New York.
In the two decades following the American Civil War, a number of institutional buildings were constructed in the Gothic Revival style in Middletown. The design of this church is representative of that pattern.
The church continues to be used as a church and is in good condition. The restoration of most of the stained glass windows was completed in 2011. Its current rector is
the Rev. Dana Campbell.
The former rectory at 144 Broad Street, also known as the Bishop Acheson House, is now St. Luke's Housing for the Elderly. It is of the Colonial Revival style and was built in 1902-1903. The builder and architect are not known.
This large house is set back from the street on a large, well landscaped lot. The street is primarily residential with mid to late 19th century houses. Nearby are two small commercial buildings and the Gothic Revival Russell Library.
This house, built in 1902, was the third rectory of the Holy Trinity Church. The Reverend Edward Campion Acheson, the eighteenth rector of the church, was the first occupant. His son, Dean Acheson, served as Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman. Upon the Reverend Mr. Acheson's resignation from the pulpit in 1915 he became the sixth Bishop of Connecticut. the house no longer serves as a rectory for Holy Trinity Church. It is now residential apartments for the elderly, known as St. Luke's. 
This large house is an excellent example of the Georgian Revival style, with well executed details: six column entrance portico with balustrade; Palladian window; and modillioned cornice.
The building has been converted into an elderly residential apartments run by St. Luke's. The property is in very good condition.
