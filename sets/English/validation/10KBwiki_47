Hamid Hayat (born September 10, 1983) is a United States citizen of Pakistani descent from Lodi, California. His father, Umer Hayat (born January 5, 1958), was born in Pakistan and emigrated to the United States in 1976; he is a naturalized American citizen. Together they were the subjects of the first terrorism trial in the state of California. Both were alleged to be part of, or associated with, a terrorist sleeper cell.
In June 2005 Hamid Hayat was arrested and charged with providing material support to terrorists, and of lying about it to FBI agents. The prosecution alleged that Hamid Hayat had spent the better part of two years at an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan, returning in 2005 with an intent to attack civilian targets in the United States. The defense contended that Hayat was in Pakistan to engage an arranged marriage. On April 25, 2006, a jury voted to convict Hamid Hayat of one count of providing material support or resources to terrorists and three counts of making false statements to the FBI in matters related to international or domestic terrorism. The maximum penalty for these charges is 39 years of imprisonment. Sentencing was set for July 14, 2006, before U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr.
His father, Umer Hayat, was also arrested and charged with two counts of making false statements to the FBI regarding the investigation of his son and of certain members of the Muslim community of Lodi. Umer's charges ended in a hung jury. When faced with a retrial for the same offenses, he pled guilty in exchange for a release with time served.
The younger Hayat's conviction is controversial in some circles. Supporters of the Hayats believe them to be innocents railroaded by overzealous FBI agents and post-9/11 Islamophobia. They cite the occasionally outlandish nature of the confessions, especially Umer's, in particular where he describes a supposed al-Qaeda training camp populated by a thousand men doing "pole vault" practice in ninja masks (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle masks, according to the Los Angeles Times).
Hamid Hayat's attorney, Wazhma Mojaddidi, also claims that he had been worn down by the FBI's five-hour interrogation and confessed to crimes he did not commit. Hamid and Umer Hayat's separate, videotaped confessions were the linchpin of the government's case. Former FBI agent James Wedick Jr., a veteran of 35 years, believed the confessions had been coaxed with intimidation and leading questions. Wedick was never allowed to testify and present his analysis of the confession videotapes at Hamid Hayat's original trial. Prior to being contacted by defense attorneys for Hamid Hayat, Wedick had had no knowledge of or involvement with the case.
The government argued that there is a greater pattern at work. A government informant taped him saying, in regard to the murder of Daniel Pearl by Pakistani terrorists: "They killed him. So I'm pleased about that. They cut him into pieces and sent him back. That was a good job they did. Now they can't send one Jewish person to Pakistan." FBI agents also recovered from his room jihadist magazines (e.g. of the Jaish-e-Mohammed) and a "jihad scrapbook" containing articles praising the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. Hamid also carried in his wallet a supposed "jihadi supplication" reading "O Allah we place you at their throats and we seek refuge in you from their evils."
Much was made of how Umer Hayat seemed to possess sums of cash unusual for an ice-cream-truck driver with only an 8th grade education (e.g. a $390,000 home with no outstanding debt). According to U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell, Hayat "appears to have access to a significant amount of cash from an unexplained source."
There is also a tenuous family connection to radical Islam: Umer's father-in-law, Hamid's maternal grandfather, is a prominent leader in the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a conservative, strictly religious political party in Pakistan strongly associated with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Previously, on April 19, 2003, father and son had been stopped at Dulles International Airport on the way to Pakistan. They were attempting to illegally carry $28,093 in cash out of the country. According to the defense, this was money they had saved to build a vacation home in Pakistan and to pay for Hamid's wedding and the wedding of his sister.
After his initial conviction Hamid Hayat sought a new trial, for which his attorneys, Wazhma Mojaddidi and Dennis Riordan, filed a motion on the grounds of misconduct by jury foreman Joseph Cote as well as other court misconduct. Cote allegedly used racial slurs during the trial and compared Hayat to the Pakistani men who had conducted the recent terrorist attacks in London (see 7 July 2005 London bombings and 21 July 2005 London bombings). Cote also contacted an excused alternative juror during deliberations.
The hearing was held on April 6, 2007. On May 17, 2007, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. rejected a new trial for Hamid Hayat, writing in his ruling that the reports of juror misconduct were not credible. Hamid Hayat's defense attorney, Wazhma Mojaddidi, announced plans to appeal.
On September 10, 2007, Hamid Hayat was sentenced to 24 years in federal prison. It was his 25th birthday. In the words of Federal Judge Garland Burrell Jr., Hayat had re-entered the U.S. "ready and willing to wage violent jihad."
The Hamid Hayat case is seen as an example of a pre-crime conviction (McCulloch and Wilson 2016).The dissenting Judge Tashima in Hayat’s unsuccessful appeal argued he would reverse the conviction “because the judicial branch’s constitutional duty to do justice in criminal prosecutions was not fulfilled in this case in which the government asked a jury to deprive a man of his liberty largely based on dire, but vague, predictions that the defendant might commit unspecified crimes in the future” (United States v Hayat 2013: 4, 59, emphasis in original). Judge Tashima acknowledged that the law permitted conviction on the basis that the defendant might commit such unspecified crimes in the future, but argued that when the law allows for such convictions every aspect of the trial should be scrupulously fair, and that Hayat’s trial did not meet this standard. The majority likewise described the government’s “preventative approach” as “one that permits the conviction of potential terrorists who may never in fact have committed any terrorist act if not arrested and convicted” (United States v Hayat 2013: 24).

The Almond Valley Light Railway is a narrow gauge heritage railway running at the Almond Valley Heritage Trust site at Livingston, Scotland. The railway operates at weekends between Easter and the end of September and daily during some school holiday periods. There are two stations, both with waiting shelters and run round loops. A small two-road loco shed is provided at the Heritage centre end of the line. There is a storage siding here also.
The line uses only internal combustion locomotives. It has never intended to use steam locomotives and therefore has no facilities for them. The railway is home to a number of electric locomotives (five battery, one overhead); however, these are not used. All of the battery locomotives are likely to require new batteries before being used again.
The railway's passenger stock consists of three air braked coaches constructed on-site using ex-RNAD wagon underframes. An ex-RNAD all steel bogie brake van also forms part of the passenger train. In addition to this, the railway has a small selection of ex-RNAD wagons (two tank wagons, a covered van and an open wagon).
The railway's gauge trackwork consists of flat-bottomed rail mounted using pandrol clips onto Costain concrete sleepers (wooden sleepers are used for pointwork). All track is ex-RNAD. There are some seven sets of points on the route, all of which are manually controlled by an adjacent lever.
The railway operates on the "one engine in steam" principle and has no signals. A single line token is carried by the locomotive using the line.

Goldilocks Bakeshop is a bakeshop chain based in the Philippines, which produces and distributes Philippine cakes and pastries.
On May 15, 1966, Filipino-Chinese sisters, Milagros Leelin Yee and Clarita Leelin Go, and their sister-in-law Doris Wilson Leelin, opened the first Goldilocks store on a space on the ground floor of a three-story building along Pasong Tamo Street in Makati and started with only 10 employees.
In 1976, Goldilocks opened its first store in the United States in Los Angeles. In 1991, Goldilocks launched a franchising program which led to the opening of hundreds of Goldilocks' store in Metro Manila.
Other stores were later set up in other parts of California such as San Francisco, San Jose and in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Pancake House International planned to acquire Goldilocks Bakeshop, but negotiations to acquire the bakeshop chain fell in 2006. Pancake House offered to acquire Goldilocks for .
In 2015, it was reported that there are at least 400 full-service stores in the Philippines, 12 in California, United States, and three in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Goldilocks was named after Goldilocks, a character from the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears to make the name of the chain easier to remember by children and their mothers. The name also suggests the words "gold" and "luck" which was viewed to be auspicious. The naming was suggested by the founders' sister Maria Flor.
In 2010, Goldilocks underwent a full re-branding.
