KBXD (1480 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Dallas, Texas. The station features a Hindi hit music radio format for the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex South Asian community. It calls itself "Radio Salaam Namaste." KBXD's broadcast license is held by ACM JCE IV B LLC. 
In recent years, the station got a boost in daytime power to 50,000 watts, the maximum for AM stations. It reduces power at night to 1900 watts to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1480. The transmitter is off of South Saint Augustine Road in Dallas.
The station, now known as KBXD, signed on as KGKO on January, 1953. The station played pop music and jazz. In 1958, KGKO changed its call sign to KBOX and it adopted a Top 40 format to compete with Gordon McLendon's top-rated 1190 KLIF. Future WABC disc jockey Dan Ingram was an early voice on KBOX. Within a year, the station, known variously as "Wonderful K-Box in Dallas," "Big Top Radio," and "Tiger Radio," had rocketed from the bottom of the ratings to a near-tie with KLIF, and remained highly rated through the coming decade. K-Box was the only radio station covering President John F. Kennedy's motorcade live when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. (Although KLIF was widely acclaimed for its later coverage of the President's death and the ensuing events, it was not broadcasting live from the motorcade route.)
KBOX put an FM station on the air at 100.3 MHz on Christmas Day, 1965. KBOX-FM mostly simulcast KBOX AM 1480. It later took a beautiful music format as KMEZ-FM and today is KJKK.
Group One Broadcasting of Texas acquired KBOX from Balaban Broadcasting in 1967 for $2 million.
KBOX had never been able to defeat KLIF in the Top 40 arena. So on January 24, 1967, KBOX changed direction and went to a country format. The first song played on the new country KBOX was "I've Got a Tiger By the Tail" by Buck Owens (a nod to the station's former "Tiger Radio" moniker). 
KPCN 730 AM (now KKDA) was the first country station in the area, having started in 1962, but it broadcast during the daytime only. KBOX quickly became the ratings leader for country music in Dallas. In its first ratings book, it moved from a 10.0 share Q3 1966 to a 12.1 share in Q1 1967. KBOX had six years of solid ratings, posting a high of 14.4 in the Q3 1967 book. In 1972, 830 WBAP began giving KBOX stiff competition as a country-formatted 50,000 watt powerhouse. WBAP gained many listeners from KBOX.
In 1973, the Arbitron markets for Dallas and Fort Worth were combined into one book, to reflect the merging of the two cities into one metropolitan area. KBOX, like other smaller stations, was hurt by this redefinition. Some, like KBOX, did not even appear in the new ratings book. WBAP became the clear country winner at that point, as KBOX barely reached the Ft. Worth half of the newly defined market.
In April 1974, Group One applied for a nighttime power increase from 500 watts to 1 kilowatt and a move of the transmitter site to 32 52 15 N 96 42 54 W. The Federal Communications Commission approved it in February 1975. This gave KBOX a better signal, which is probably what allowed it to struggle into the 1980s, providing a more local service to Dallas, since WBAP is licensed to Fort Worth. But by 1980, FM radio was growing in dominance and the ability of KBOX to compete with a music format was waning.
On November 14, 1982, the KBOX call letters were dropped by Group One. KBOX became KMEZ and switched from its country format to a simulcast of the easy listening format of sister station KMEZ-FM.
In 1989, KMEZ-AM broke away from the FM station to adopt a Business News/Talk format as KDBN. This was followed in 1991 by the satellite-fed "Stardust" Adult Standards service from the Unistar Radio Network as KCMZ.
Marcos A. Rodriguez purchased the station and changed the format to Spanish-language Banda music with call sign KMRT (1993–1998). Marcos A. Rodriguez picked the calls to connote the retailer K-Mart and imply good value for advertisers. KMRT was the first radio station in America to air the Banda format all the time. It operated with an automated Audio Server delivery.
Eventually, the call sign changed to KDXX (1998–2002), and KHCK (1998–2005), a simulcast of Tejano KHCK-FM "Kick FM" until the FM changed format to Cumbia music as KFZO and the AM continued as a stand-alone Tejano station for a few months. The KNIT call letters and a Southern Gospel format were adopted in March 2005, when it was briefly owned by Salem Communications.
In June 2007, the station joined the Spanish language sports network ESPN Deportes Radio, and it was the first ESPN Deportes station to be managed and operated by ESPN. 1540 KZMP picked up the ESPN Deportes format on June 1, 2009, almost two years after the format was first aired in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The Deportes format was dropped by 1480 in August 2009.
KBXD, along with co-owned stations WFLL, WFTL, and WMEN, was purchased out of bankruptcy by Mark Jorgenson's ACM JCE IV B LLC in a transaction that was consummated on August 6, 2015, at a purchase price of $5.5 million. A proposed sale to Chris Muse for $1.5 million on May 13, 2016, plus a $13,000 payment to break the station’s tower lease, was terminated without closing. The transmitting site was acquired from Salem Radio Properties. KBXD switched its format to South Asian pop music. In April 2017 the station suspended all programming and started running a continuous advertisement asking the listener "If you are interested in renting this radio station call John Hammond at"... The station is not transmitting a legal ID as required by the FCC. As of mid June 2017, the station is playing Hispanic music with station breaks in Spanish.

Israel of Krems was an Austrian rabbi who flourished in the 14th and 15th centuries. He was the great-grandfather of Israel ben Petahiah Isserlein, who quotes him in his commentary on Rashi to the Pentateuch, section "Wayeḥi." Israel was the author of "Haggahot Asheri," notes on Rabbeinu Asher's Talmudic compendium, printed with the text. Grätz identifies Israel of Krems with the Israel whom Emperor Rupert appointed, by a decree of May 3, 1407, chief rabbi of all the German communities ("Hochmeister über alle Rabbinen"), giving him a certificate declaring him to be a great Talmudic scholar and a good man.
But as Israel's functions included the civil control of the Jews, and especially the collection of the taxes, the German rabbis opposed his appointment. Some of them even threatened him with excommunication in case he did not resign. The emperor, upon hearing of this, confirmed Israel's appointment as chief rabbi by a second decree (November 23, 1407), imposing a fine of twenty gold marks on any one refusing to submit to him. But the edicts had little effect, and the office of the chief rabbi became obsolete soon after its creation. No further mention of Israel occurs until 1415, when he is mentioned in a document of Emperor Sigismund, appointing him to superintend the collection of the Jewish taxes, in which office he was the subordinate of the hereditary chamberlain Conrad of Weinsberg.

"Last Child" is a song by American rock band Aerosmith. It was written by Steven Tyler and Brad Whitford and released as the first single from the album "Rocks" in 1976. It peaked at #21 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, one of a string of hits for the band in the mid-1970s.
The song is one of Brad Whitford's best-known contributions to the band. "Brad wrote, 'Take me back to sweet Tallahassee, home sweet home…'" recalled Tyler. "Whatever he put into 'Last Child', that's his moment. He can take that, and that's his, forever."
Live, Whitford plays a variation of the guitar solo as heard on the original recording. The song opens like a slow song, with careful playing of the guitar and Tyler's dreamy lyrics. After 22 seconds, it abruptly changes to a hard rocking, bluesy song, complete with a boogie background and two-guitar interplay between Whitford and Joe Perry, with Whitford playing the low notes of the riff on the verse and Perry playing funk chords higher up the neck.
Long after its release, "Last Child" enjoys regular airplay on rock radio and is regularly rotated into Aerosmith's concert setlist, even on their latest tour. In concert, it is often Whitford's feature spot, in which Tyler introduces him with something like "Brad Whitford, what do you got to show for yourself?" or "What do you got up your sleeve?" Whitford often does a little bit of an intro before playing the opening notes to the song.
Although it is often assumed that the guitar solo as heard on the studio recording was played by Joe Perry, it has been rumored to have been played by an uncited (hired) guitarist. During his appearance as a guest on "That Metal Show" in 2012, Whitford stated that he actually wrote and performed the solo himself.
"Last Child" has been rereleased on compilations including "Aerosmith's Greatest Hits", "O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits", and "" as well as live collections including "Live! Bootleg", "Classics Live II", and "A Little South of Sanity".
The song is one of Aerosmith's most funk-based tracks, modeled after the band The Meters.
Mickey Thomas, Earl Slick, Nathan East and Steve Ferrone covered the song for the Aerosmith tribute album "Not the Same Old Song and Dance" (Eagle Records, 1999).
A cover version of this song appears in the game "Guitar Hero II". The cover is based on the live version from "A Little South of Sanity".
