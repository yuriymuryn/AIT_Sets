The Abbey, Ditcheat (formerly known as The Priory) is a large house at Ditcheat in Somerset. Originally a rectory, now converted into a house, the Grade II* listed building dates from the 15th century. To the rear of the Abbey is a Grade II listed granary.
The Abbey was built as the rectory by John Gunthorpe who was rector of Ditcheat and Dean of Wells, in 1473. The house was altered in 1667 for Christopher Coward; and given a new facade and rearranged internally in 1864–68, probably by James Piers St Aubyn for Rev. William Leir. 
The building is constructed of rubble stone, dressed with freestones. The roof is tiled with stone tiles, there are stone finials and grouped ashlar chimneystacks. Originally set out as a hall house, but changed later to form an L-shaped floorplan. The building is two storeys high, with four gables on the frontage, two smaller triangular ones and two larger ogee headed ones. 
The exterior is now mostly his Victorian neo-Tudor; inside there are reused fragments and some original 15th- and 17th-century work – coffered ceilings and the arch-braced roof of the ‘chapel wing’, but most of the elaborate Gothic work dates from the 1860s. It was designated a Grade II* listed building on 2 June 1961.
At the rear of the Abbey, there is an square 18th century granary, built round a timber-frame, with brick filled between the wood. The roof is pyramid shaped, tiled and ends in stone tiles. The granary was designated Grade II listed status on 25 February 1988.

Willie MacFarlane (17 March 1930 – 11 March 2010) was a Scottish football player and manager, most notable for playing for and managing Hibernian.
MacFarlane played as a full–back for Hibernian in the 1950s, when the club featured the forward line known as The Famous Five. He was born in Leith and brought up in the same area (Hutcheson) as goalkeeper Tommy Younger, with whom he played for Hutcheson Vale and the Army. Both players were then signed for Hibs by manager Hugh Shaw. He was taken by Hibs on a tour of Brazil in 1953 to play in three games in the Maracana stadium against Vasco da Gama, Botafogo and Fluminense. MacFarlane also played for Hibs in the first season of the European Cup, playing in five of the six matches possible. Hibs eventually lost to Stade Reims in the semi-final, where MacFarlane was pitted against Raymond Kopa.
Former teammate Tommy Preston described MacFarlane as "resolute", "strong" and capable of striking a good free kick.
MacFarlane played for Raith Rovers and Morton later in his playing career.
MacFarlane began his managerial career with East of Scotland League club Hawick Royal Albert. He joined Stirling Albion in March 1968, before taking a similar post at Hibernian in 1969. Chairman William Harrower appointed MacFarlane to replace Bob Shankly, who had resigned. Despite suffering early exits in the two cup competitions, Hibs qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by finishing third in the Scottish League. During that first season, MacFarlane's team set a club record for consecutive wins. Hibs beat Malmö and Vitória de Guimarães to progress to the third round of the Fairs Cup, where they would lose to Bill Shankly's Liverpool side. That tie with Liverpool led to MacFarlane's departure from Hibs. Chairman Tom Hart, who had just bought the club from Harrower, overruled him on team selection and sacked MacFarlane prior to the match.
MacFarlane "oversaw the early stages of one of the finest ever Hibernian sides". Having signed Erich Schaedler in his previous managerial post at Stirling Albion, MacFarlane made Schaedler his first signing as Hibs manager. He moved John Brownlie from playing in central defence to an attacking full back role, an "inspirational" choice. Having sold Peter Marinello to Arsenal for a record transfer fee, MacFarlane then signed Falkirk player Johnny Graham, who scored a hat-trick in his first game. He also signed Arthur Duncan, who went on to set the record for most league appearances for Hibs. Former player John Fraser, who worked as a coach for MacFarlane, described him as an "enthusiastic" manager, who established a good rapport with his players.
After leaving Hibs, MacFarlane had a spell as manager of Meadowbank Thistle between 1978 and 1980. MacFarlane also ran a bookmakers business in Edinburgh and regularly attended matches at Easter Road. He was also a keen golf player and karaoke singer. MacFarlane died in hospital on the morning of 11 March 2010, after a "short illness".



"Hakuna Matata" is a song from Disney's 32nd animated feature "The Lion King". The song is based on Timon and Pumbaa's catchphrase in the movie, "Hakuna matata", which is a Swahili phrase; it means 'no worries'. It is characterized by its simple 4/4 time, upbeat message and catchy lyrics.
The musical score was written by Elton John and the lyrics by Tim Rice. In the film the song is sung by Timon (a meerkat voiced by Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (a warthog voiced by Ernie Sabella), and Simba, a young lion voiced by Jason Weaver (singing voice as a cub) and Joseph Williams (as an adult). Taking place after the death of Mufasa, it features (Timon and Pumbaa), the two main comedy characters in the film, talking to Simba about moving forward from their troubled pasts and forgetting their worries, and Simba grows from cub to adult as the song progresses. The song also provides a backstory for Pumbaa, explaining that he was ostracized from animal society for his excessive flatulence. It makes use of a large proportion of the orchestra as well as many other more unusual instruments including an elaborate drum kit. Rice is said to have got the idea for the lyrics for the song from watching the comedy series "Bottom" and at one point wanted the show's stars Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to play Timon and Pumbaa.
A second version of the song, produced for the companion album "Rhythm of the Pride Lands", was performed by Jimmy Cliff featuring Lebo M. This version has a slightly modified, previously unreleased verse focusing on Timon's past. It was partially rewritten with a different instrument arrangement, but remains very similar to the original. This version of the song was released as a single with "He Lives in You" as a B-side and was ultimately used in the Broadway theatrical version of "The Lion King".
The song was based on an earlier song written early on in the production stage called "Warthog Rhapsody". Although the two songs shared the same message and position in the film, when Elton and Tim began to work on the music the song was completely rewritten and it eventually evolved into "Hakuna Matata". "Warthog Rhapsody" was eventually re-produced and released on "Rhythm of the Pride Lands".
The melody of Warthog Rhaspody was used in "The Lion King 1½" for the song "That's All I Need".
"Hakuna matata" is a phrase in Swahili that is frequently translated as "no worries". In a bonus features of "The Lion King" Special Edition DVD, the film's production team claims that it picked up the term from a tour guide while on safari in Kenya. It was then developed into an ideology that, along with the seemingly antithetical value of duty to the monarchy, is central to the moral content of the film.
The title phrase is pronounced with American English phonology within the song, including a flapped "t", rather than as it is pronounced in Swahili.
The song became enormously popular and was nominated for Best Song at the 67th Academy Awards but lost to "Can You Feel the Love Tonight", one of three "Lion King" song nominations (the third one was "Circle of Life"). It was also ranked 99th in the AFI's list of the 100 best American movie songs of all time, Disney's seventh and last entry of songs on the list (the others being "When You Wish Upon a Star" from "Pinocchio" at #7, "Some Day My Prince Will Come" from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" at #19, "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" from "Mary Poppins" at #36, "Wind Beneath My Wings" from "Beaches" at #44, "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" from "Song of the South" at #47, and "Beauty and the Beast" from "Beauty and the Beast" at #62).
A shortened version of "Hakuna Matata" was used as the theme song of the spinoff "Timon & Pumbaa" TV show.
Another shortened version of "Hakuna Matata" was also used on the TV series "The Lion Guard" in the first-season episode "Bunga and the King" (2016), and was sung by the characters of the show.
