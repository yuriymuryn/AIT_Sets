Ierax (, "Hawk") was a which served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 1912–1946.
The ship, along with her three sister ships , and , was ordered from England. They were purchased in 1912, ready for delivery, each for the sum of £148,000 from the English shipyards Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely. These ships had originally been ordered by Argentina; "Ierax" was originally named "Santa Fé". "Ierax" was accepted by Captain Ath. Miaoulis, RHN in Palermo, Sicily. where she arrived manned by foreign crew.
During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunitions, 3,000 rounds of torpedoes. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. On October 21, 1912, under the command of Commander A. Vratsanos, RHN, "Ierax" was part of the Greek flotilla that captured the island of Psara from the Ottomans.
During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Beast Class ships were seized by the Allies in October, 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea.
"Ierax" participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1918, and saw action in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) in the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea.
After the war, "Ierax" was refurbished from 1925–1927. She also participated in the Second World War, after surviving the German invasion of April, 1941, "Ierax" was based in Alexandria, Egypt. In April, 1944, a wave of mutiny swept through some of the Hellenic Royal Navy, with seamen agitating in favor of the pro-Communist guerillas, ELAS, who were fighting a campaign in Greece against the occupying Nazis. "Ierax" was one of the ships whose crew mutinied and the mutiny was put down in the early morning hours of April 22, 1944.
After the end of World War II, "Ierax" was stricken (decommissioned) in 1946.

Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is uncommon among companion animals. The bacteria "Streptococcus mutans" and "Streptococcus sanguis" cause dental caries by metabolising sugars.
The term "feline cavities" is commonly used to refer to feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, however, sacchrolytic acid-producing bacteria (the same responsible for Dental plaque) are not involved in this condition.
Although rarely seen in cats, the incidence of caries in dogs has been estimated at approximately 5%. Dogs are less likely than humans to have tooth decay due to the very high pH of dog saliva, which prevents an acidic environment from forming and the subsequent demineralization of enamel which would occur. In the event that tooth decay does occur (usually from trauma), dogs can receive dental fillings just as humans do.

Altheides (1193–1262) was a Cypriot philosopher, primarily known from sayings attributed to him in the works of others. Little is known about the wandering philosopher known as Altheides of Cyprus, and little of his work remains available to modern scholars. His parents were Greek merchants living on the island under the rule of Guy of Lusignan. He was born a year before Guy's death, in 1193. At some point in his late teens he left Cyprus as a seaman on a Moorish trading vessel.
Altheides again turns up in historical records with the founding of his School of Philosophy in Jerusalem in 1226, under the rule of al-Kamil, the nephew of Saladin and ruler of Jerusalem. His school was never particularly successful, and dispersed shortly after al-Kamil's treaty of 1229 signing the city back over to the Crusaders. From this point very little is known. Scattered accounts and writings appear here and there in as varied locations as Spain, Morocco, Rome, and Egypt. Altheides died near his childhood home on Cyprus in 1262.
Altheides never wrote a serious philosophical work or treatise and is primarily known for his many wise sayings, primarily found in other works written in the early thirteenth century.
We are running towards a precipice; we can but hope that when we reach the edge we shall be able to fly. [Of education and training, Jerusalem, 1227]
If anyone asks you if you can do something, have only two answers: 'yes' and 'not yet.' [Jerusalem, 1227]
A clever man is capable of solving puzzles, and a knowledgeable man knows many answers. But only a wise man knows which puzzles to solve and which questions to ask. [Of human perception of intelligence, Athens, 1236]
Life is full of boundaries; a life lived within them is a life not worth living at all. [Athens, unknown year]
